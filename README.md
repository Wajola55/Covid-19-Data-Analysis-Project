## Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Project
##### This is a project that deals with COVID-19 data analysis and visualization using Python programming language. The project uses two datasets:

##### <b> 1.Covid-19 Global Dataset: This dataset provides up-to-date numbers of daily confirmed, death and active cases for 225 countries.</b>

#### <b> 2.Covid-19 World Vaccination Progress: This dataset provides daily and total vaccination for Covid-19 in the world from Our World in Data.</b>

#### <b>3.The project involves data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. First, unnecessary columns are removed, and the data is aggregated by country and date range in both datasets.</b>

#### <b>Then, the top 20 countries are selected and plotted to visualize the COVID-19 cumulative deaths and people fully vaccinated by
country.</b>

<b>4.Data cleaning and manipulation are done using the pandas library, and data visualization is done using various Python libraries such as matplotlib,
seaborn, and plotly. The final output of the project is a set of two visualizations showing the COVID-19 cumulative deaths and people fully vaccinated 
by country.</b>
